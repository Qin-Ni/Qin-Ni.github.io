## Looking for postdoc position!

I'm a PhD candidate working on computational modeling of cytoskeletal networks. I'm currently looking for postdoc position starting 2021 spring semester. If you are interested, check my [CV here](https://qin-ni.github.io/QinNi-CV.pdf). Feel free to contact me at qin.ni.0909@gmail.com.
